# Copycat-bot-and-text-generator
The project has two main parts, a copy-cat bot and a content generator. The copy-cat bot is a model that can learn the writing style of a certain author and replicate it. lets say for example we feed it jk rowling's books, and then give it an article as an input, it'll rewrite it using her writing style. The content generator can be used to generate content(article, posts, tweets ..etc) based on either a summary or a category or on some other means (still undecided), it'll take the summary as input and give us an article about the input as output. The project will be in English, and it will be used as a tool for fully automated blogs.
//*NEW* Copycat discord bot- The copycat discord bot is an advanced say bot that is desigined for flexibility and the ablity to hook into other bots.
